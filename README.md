## Configuration

You can configure the application in two ways:

### Option 1: Using the setup script

Run the setup script to create the `.env` file:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This script will prompt you for the necessary configuration values and create the `.env` file for you.

### Option 2: Manual configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token

# BTCPay Server Configuration
BTCPAY_URL=https://your.btcpayserver.com
BTCPAY_API_KEY=your_btcpay_api_key
BTCPAY_STORE_ID=your_btcpay_store_id

# Database Configuration
DB_PATH=./btc_trades.db
```

The application will automatically load these environment variables when it starts.

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build the application
go build -o btc-shop

# Run the application
./btc-shop
```
